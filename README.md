# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard where a user can check the weather outlook for multiple cities. When a user searches for a city, the city name, date, icon of the weather condition, temperature, humidity and uv index are displayed, along with a 5 day forecast. When multiple cities are searched, the user is then able to go back to the search history and select the previously searched cities to have its respective current and future conditions displayed.
